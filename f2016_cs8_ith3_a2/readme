This program prompts you to enter a "File to be read" and if that file exists
it will go in and total  the distance ran for every line in the file which
is formatted correctly. The output concists of the total distance ran recorded
in that specific file, and the total number of lines that were formatted
correctly in that file. If there is a line which does not have a name, it will
notify the user which line does not have a name, and still include that distance
in the summation. If the line is not formatted correctly in some other way it is
not included in the calculation, and the program will notify the user how many
lines in the file contain these errors and exactly where these errors are. This
helps a lot if this program was dealing with files with many many more lines than
just 50. The file will keep looping through this process and the user can enter
and many files as s/he wants, until they enter "","quit", or "q" into the file
name. At this point the program prints the total lines and distance ran throughout
all files read and then the program ends. Also every item (except the error
notifications)that is printed is put through a function that formats whatever
int, float, or string passed to it in the format defined in the program
specifications.
