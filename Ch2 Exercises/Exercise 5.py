### EXERCISE 5 ###

#Labeling for your convenience
print("Exercise 5:\n")

#Define speed for equation work
v = 90
#Finding the distance traveled after a given time (x4)
d6 = v * 6
d10 = v * 10
d15 = v * 15
d225 = v * 29/12
#converting numbers to strings to print in the output (x4)
d6 = str(d6)
d10 = str(d10)
d15 = str(d15)
d225 = str(d225)
#Output (x4)
print("The car will travel " + d6 + "km in 6 hours going 90 km/hr")
print("The car will travel " + d10 + "km in 10 hours going 90 km/hr")
print("The car will travel " + d15 + "km in 15 hours going 90 km/hr")
print("The car will travel " + d225 + "km in 2 hours and 25 minutes going 90 km/hr\n\n")
#Done
