The main function of this program has 5 blocks:

The first block prompts the user for the master input list. If the file they
type into the console exists, it will open the file and store the file names
contained in the master input list. If the file does not exist it tells the
user that the file does not exist and asks for the master input list again.

The second block takes each file that was stored in the master input list
and opens it, and goes through each line. For each line read, if the persons
name is already in the participants dictionary, their distance is added to
the existing object. If they are not in the dictionary, a new object is
created and added.

The third block of text simply initializes a bunch of variables that will be
used to gather the requested statistics.

The fourth block goes through every object in our participant dictionary and
writes the necessary info in the output file we create at the start of the block.
Then the rest of the block gathers the stats we want for the console output.
Finally we close the output file.

The fifth block just prints the requested console output making use of the
formatItem() function, which formats strs, ints, and floats to the requested
parameters.
