The main function of this program has 5 blocks:

The first block prompts the user for the master input list. If the file they
type into the console exists, it will open the file and store the file names
contained in the master input list. If the file does not exist it tells the
user that the file does not exist and asks for the master input list again.

The second block takes each file that was stored in the master input list
and opens it, storing all the information of the runners distances run
in a dictionary, making use of the makeDict() function which returns the
dictionary as well as the number of participant lines read. For each item
in the dictionary it adds new participants to a dictionary of participant
objects, with the key being the participants name, or if the participant
already has an object it simply adds the distance to the existing object.

The third block of text simply initializes a bunch of variables that will be
used to gather the requested statistics.

The fourth block goes through every object in our participant dictionary and
writes the necessary info in the output file we create at the start of the block.
Then the rest of the block gathers the stats we want for the console output.
Finally we close the output file.

The fifth block just prints the requested console output making use of the
formatItem() function, which formats strs, ints, and floats to the requested
parameters.
